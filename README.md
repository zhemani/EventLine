# EventLine

YHacks (Yale Hackathon) - Travel Hack

EventLine is a website which eases the process of booking hotels near events. The site allows users to search for any event using a keyword being the event name, artisit/ performers name, or the general location/ city of the event. Users can then pick and book the event directly on the site as well as choose a hotel near the event. A map can be displayed showing close proximity to the event in regards to the location of the hotel. Users can also filter hotels based on price, star range, and ammentities. The hotel can then also be booked directly on the site. 

EventLine eases the process of attending events by encompassing the tough task of booking a hotel and booking an event into one.
